# Definition

JPEG Ghost Detection is a forensic technique used to identify regions in an image that have undergone different compression histories.  
It helps expose splicing or tampering by analyzing inconsistencies in JPEG compression artifacts.

---

# Example

Suppose an original image is saved at quality 95, and a region is later inserted and re-saved at quality 75. JPEG ghost detection may reveal this through heatmaps or residual differences.

## Selected Research & Literature: JPEG Ghost

1. [Image Forgery Detection and Localization using Modified JPEG Ghost]  
- Describes a technique for detecting and localizing image forgery in JPEGs by analyzing compression artifacts, especially after multiple compressions. Modified JPEG Ghost detection is used to identify and pinpoint manipulated regions based on disparities in JPEG block alignment.

2. [Detection of JPEG Ghost in Non-Aligned Spliced Region of JPEG Images]  
- Explores JPEG Ghost as a forensic method for exposing image splicing, especially when copied regions have lower compression quality. Discusses challenges and recovery when spliced regions are not grid-aligned.
